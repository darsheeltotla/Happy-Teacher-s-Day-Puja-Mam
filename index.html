      <br><br>,
I'm happy that you're my teacher;
      <br>
I enjoy each lesson you teach.
      <br>
As my role model you inspire me
      <br>
To dream and to work and to reach.
      <br><br>
With your kindness you get my attention;
      <br>
Every day you are planting a seed
      <br>
Of curiosity and motivation
      <br>
To know and to grow and succeed.
      <br><br>

You help me fulfill my potential;
      <br>
I'm thankful for all that you've done.
      <br>
I admire you each day, and I just want to say,
      <br>
As a teacher, you're number one!
      <br><br>
